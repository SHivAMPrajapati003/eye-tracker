# Eye Tracker 👀

This is a fun and interactive Eye Tracker project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates a pair of eyes that follow your mouse movement across the screen.

## 🧠 How it works

1. Two circular eyes are created using HTML and styled with CSS.
2. JavaScript listens to the `mousemove` event on the page.
3. Based on the cursor’s coordinates, each eye rotates in the direction of the cursor.
